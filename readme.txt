	A junior developer has developed a website and uploaded the code to this GIT repository for review.  After you review the document, you discover several issues that need to be fixed.  Follow the below instructions to correct the document.  You can use any editor you want to resolve the problem.	

1 - Download this project from GIT to your local machine
2 - On line 45 of the question.html document, create a html table with 5 columns and 3 rows using the below data

	Customer Name, Address, City, State, ZIP
	Mcdonalds, 123 60th St, Tampa, FL, 33511
	Burger King, 88th Jackson St, St. Pete, FL, 33511

2 - In the document ready function, make a call to the "get_data" function on line 69 and pass the below numbers as a list array.  Provide that list array to the chart's data variable, so that the graph works correctly

	21213
	1213213
	12123
	123131
	21312
	12121

3 - Load the CSS files that were provided into the html document.
